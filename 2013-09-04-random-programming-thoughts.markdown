* [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) feels better than Mac OS X's built-in terminal, though I'm not quite sure yet why.  Maybe it's the tabs.  I don't use the transparency, nor the TextExpander-like functionality.  It's gotta be the tabs.  Using CMD and arrows to go from tab to tab makes things very easy.

* Re-learning Ruby and Rails has been a process.  Ruby is pretty straight-forward to me.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: Ruby feels to me like Object Oriented Perl.  There are a lot of similarities.  It's what Perl 6 should have been, maybe.  I have to get used to the idiomatic parts of it, but I can put stuff together.  Right now, though, it looks like Perl code rewritten in Ruby.  I'll get there.

* But Rails? I'm not sure what it is, but it feels like Rails has grown up so much since last I learned it six years ago that it's become more complicated with so many shortcuts that it feels like one piece of magic piled up on the next.  Reading a tutorial for Rails is a bunch of handwaving with "This is how it works, and don't worry, we'll explain how and why in Chapter 10 some 200 pages from now."

* I'm also beginning to think my problem with it is less with learning the framework and more with *how* I'm learning it.  Maybe I need some kind of video presentation?  I don't know.
