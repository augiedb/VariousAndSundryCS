[From today's USA Today interview with Craig Federighi and Jony Ive:](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/09/19/apple-jony-ive-craig-federighi/2834575/)

>Federighi is quick to admit that any engineer tasked with such a challenge would be sure to call attention to his brilliant work. "You know, you're going to have some big message saying 'Scanning!' and buzz-buzz-zzz-zzz later it says 'Authenticated,' blink-blink-blink, with 10 seconds of animation," he says, as Ive starts laughing.

>"Ultimately we realized all that had to disappear," says Federighi. "If it disappears, we know we've done it."
