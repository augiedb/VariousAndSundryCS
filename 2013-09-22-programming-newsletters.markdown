If you're looking for a handy list of relevant links to your programming interests, it turns out that a good newsletter is a handy thing. One email bomb per week with loads of information is a great thing to have.  There are three I subscribe to, in particular, that always cost me a lot of time as I create bunches of tabs to read the stories linked therein:

* [iOS Dev Weekly](http://iosdevweekly.com/) from Dave Verwer gives you the week in review from the iOS development world, as you'd expect, with a touch of editorializing and a humorous final link.

* [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/) from Peter Cooper does the same for the Ruby world. It's a bit more wide-ranging, but there's always good stories I didn't see over the week in there, too. If nothing else, it gives me more blogs to follow when I get back to my [Feedly.com](http://cloud.feedly.com) account...

* [The Changelog Weekly](http://thechangelog.com/weekly/) from Adam Stacoviak and friends recaps the week in open source releases and news.  It's even more hit and miss for me than the previous two, but I still get some golden nuggets out of here on a weekly basis.

All are free subscriptions.
