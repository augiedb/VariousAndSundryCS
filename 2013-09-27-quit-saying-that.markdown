Three quick things that bug me:

* **"At the intersection of"** was cute [when Steve Jobs used it](http://macdailynews.com/2005/10/18/steve_jobs_apples_goal_to_stand_at_the_intersection_of_tech_and_humanities/). You are not Steve Jobs. [Neither are all of these people.](http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-09-04-company-mottos-at-the-intersection-of-magical-and-cliche/)

* **"Integral"** with the emphasis on the second syllable. Maybe you can get away with this if you're British.

* **"Contribute"** with the emphasis on the first syllable.  Again, if you're British, I think this is OK. Everyone else sounds tongue-tied.
