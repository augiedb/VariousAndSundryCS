I deleted the Apple podcast app from my iPhone this past week.

It turned out not to be the source of the problem.

Ever since updating iTunes on my desktop machine, strange things are happening.  It broke my podcasts.  Every time I bring up iTunes and every time I hit the refresh button to see if there are new shows available to download, iTunes downloads the same podcast or two. Over and over and over again. This is despite the fact that I don't subscribe to one of the podcasts anymore, and that the file already exists on the computer.  

iTunes just won't stop.

I deleted the podcasts app thinking there was some conflict between it and iTunes.

Nope, still does it.

But how, you may wonder, am I still listening to podcasts on my iPhone?  It's because I created my own podcasts app, and it's something I've been using for over a year now. It's not nearly slick enough to put up on the app store. It's crude. But it has the functionality I need and I love using it.  When my Apple Developer ID expires next year and I don't renew it, I'm afraid I'm going to miss my own little podcast app.

I'm going to share some screen shots this week.

Somewhat related: The music playing app in iOS 7 stinks on ice for users like myself, who prefer to listen to albums and not playlists or random shuffles.  I tried to cue up an album I wanted to listen to for the drive home the other night and it was too difficult.  In the end, the only way I could get what I wanted was to ask Siri for it.

People make fun of Siri a lot, but she does serve a great purpose as a runaround for the deficiencies of the main visual interface.
