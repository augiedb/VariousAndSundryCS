From [Peter Seibel's excellent "Coders At Work" book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430219483/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430219483&linkCode=as2&tag=augieshcom-20) comes this quote from Joe Armstrong, creator of Erlang:

> **Seibel:** What are the statements that you use there [to debug your code]?  Print statements?

> **Armstrong:** Print statements. The great gods of programming said, "Thou shalt put *printf* statements in your program at the point where you think it's gone wrong, recompile, and run it." 

*Meta-Note: (The promised look at my iOS coding project is in the works.  Sorry for the delays...)*
