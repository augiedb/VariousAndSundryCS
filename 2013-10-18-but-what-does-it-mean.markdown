When an invite to an Apple event comes out, people spend countless hours analyzing just what it means. What's the word choice indicate? What does the color scheme indicate? What subliminal messages are we missing.

I'll parse this one out for you:

The design group at Apple was asked to make an invitation that looked cool, and they delivered one.

That's all.

They probably mocked up a couple dozen, and then some middle management type picked one.

Announcements will be made next week.  Rest easy, tech world.
