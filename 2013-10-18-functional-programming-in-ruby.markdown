Like so many these days, I'm intrigued by functional programming.  There's something so pure and so mind-bending about it that it's easy to capture your interest and attention.  I've been toying with Elixir to explore this path, which is basically Erlang rewritten by a Ruby programmer.  (Yes, that's a horribly general thing to say, but it's what attracted me to the language in the first place. So just go with it...)

Today I watched [Jessica Kerr's presentation from this year's Windy City Rails conference](http://www.windycityrails.org/videos/2013/#2) and it was awesome. It's only a half hour, but it's worth the time to see a great example of how to do functional programming with Ruby.  She has some easy to understand rules and a simple, yet solid, example to get you started.

I want to go break out some stabby lambdas now...

*October 20, 2013 Update:* Sitepoint has a three part series called ["Functional Programming Techniques With Ruby"](http://www.sitepoint.com/functional-programming-techniques-with-ruby-part-i/) that's worth a read.
