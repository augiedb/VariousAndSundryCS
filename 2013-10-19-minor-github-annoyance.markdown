Minor annoyance of the ego: I've contributed to [the Elixir Wiki page](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/wiki/Projects) two or three times now, with a few simple grammatical fixes and some new links added to the resources section.  Nothing terribly major.  It's an open Wiki.  You can basically do whatever you want. There's no approval process. This isn't like doing a pull request and hoping the owner accepts it. This is more like "accepted by a community by them not rejecting it outright," really.

But Github doesn't track those changes as being open source contributions when it comes to filling out that green graph tracking your activities:

Guess I need to work harder. . . 

(Yes, it shows up in [Public Activity](https://github.com/augiedb?tab=activity), but that's hardly as much fun as green boxes on a chart...)
