This is how we had to do it thirty years ago, from the backs of computer magazines. 

Here's the closeup:

This kind of stuff would go on for three columns per page, and multiple pages per program.  Thankfully, as I recall, the last couple of pairs were the checksum that you had typed the line in right.  You didn't go far after making a mistake...

It wasn't all bad, though: You could also mail a check out for something like $10 or $20, and they'd send you a floppy disc with all the code on it already.  Like Mom and Dad would let you get away with _that_...

For completeness' sake, here's how to enter the code:

This came out of *COMPUTE!* magazine, dated December 1987.  It had a sister publication, *COMPUTE!'S GAZETTE* that focused on Commodore computers.
