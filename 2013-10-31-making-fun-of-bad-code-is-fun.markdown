The latest con talk from Katrina Owen is now available for viewing. It's one of the funniest talks I've ever seen, though the Prisoner's Dilemma stuff at the end brings it home in a slightly less entertaining fashion.  Still, it's well worth watching, if only for the first 20 minutes.

As with her previous talks, the slides complement the talk beautifully, particularly in the way she shows code and changes in code.  You need to pay attention to the video, too. She goes fast and doesn't always narrate everything.
