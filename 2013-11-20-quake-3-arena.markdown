I came across a box of CDs from games I was playing around 1999 - 2004 this week.  It's been a treasure trove of memories.

For kicks, I tried putting the *Quake III* disc into my Mac to see if they included both PC and Mac versions of the game. This is common today, but it was a crazy notion back in the day.

As it turns out, it was neither. This was the Linux edition. The README file is hilarious. The hoops you have to jump through to make sure your video card was compiled into the game is painful.  The game included support for both 3dfx Voodoo cards and Matrox G200/G400.  Everything ran off the command line.

Figuring that my iMac is a Linux box, technically, I tried running it.  As expected, it didn't go well:

```
[AugieDB] ~ $ cd /Volumes/Quake\ III
[AugieDB] /Volumes/Quake III $ sh setup.sh
This installation doesn't support unknown on x86_64

Please contact Loki Technical Support at support@lokigames.com
[AugieDB] /Volumes/Quake III $
```

That's right; nothing was 64 bit yet back then. Heck, Mac was still on the Power PC.

Loki Games, who made a run of releasing Linux ports of popular games of the day, gave up the ghost in 2001, though [their website is still available.](http://lokigames.com)

Sadly, the *Unreal Tournament 2003* and *2004* discs I have here are Windows only. Specifically, they cover Windows 98/Me/2000/XPi/Linux.

Now I'm half-tempted to run a virtualized Windows box on my iMac to play one of these again.
