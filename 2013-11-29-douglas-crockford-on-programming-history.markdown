[The Hanselminutes Podcast](http://hanselminutes.com) is an enjoyable weekly half hour interview series touching on a varity of programming topics. I don't listen to all of them, but there are enough golden nuggets in the stream to merit staying subscribed to the feed on iTunes.

[Last month's interview with Douglas Crockford](http://hanselminutes.com/396/bugs-considered-harmful-with-douglas-crockford) is one such gem.  Crockford discusses the need for today's programmers to understand a little more about computer history for very concrete reasons, why constraints ought to be built into more languages for the greater good, and why [a bug journal](http://www.tug.org/texlive//devsrc/Master/texmf-dist/doc/generic/knuth/errata/errorlog.pdf) might be a good idea.

This is also a good opportunity to again recommend [Crockford's Yahoo presentation on Javascript](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg) which features an amazing history of computer programming.  You won't learn much about Javascript, but there's a lot of programming history there to enjoy.
