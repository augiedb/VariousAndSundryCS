While this blog was off-line for a couple months, I picked up a new gig. I'm editing an Elixir blog, [ElixirDose.com](http://elixirdose.com).  Created by [Riza Fahmi](https://twitter.com/rizafahmi22), the site is a weekly tutorial on some aspect of Elixir coding.  They're usually short and focused, until I step in and start writing something for the site.  Then, all bets are off.   Here's a list of the articles I've contributed in addition to my normal editing duties:

* [Elixir ListUtil](http://elixirdose.com/elixir-listutil/) -- Rewriting a Perl module in Elixir.
* [Elixir Deck](http://elixirdose.com/elixir-deck/) -- Writing code to generate a deck of cards. This is the first in a series.
* [Elixir Lists and Values](http://elixirdose.com/lists-and-values/) -- Remember your context!
* [Shuffling the Deck](http://elixirdose.com/shuffling-the-deck/) -- How many times do you need to shuffle a virtual deck to make it random?
* [The Erlang Calendar](http://elixirdose.com/the-erlang-calendar/) -- Use Erlang's calendar code inside your Elixir code.

I do plan on more.  I recently finished changing the code of that last project to make it [run in multiple processes](https://github.com/augiedb/Shuffle-Step-Proc).  I'm exciting to have gotten that code to run, but now I need to figure out how to explain it in a tutorial.  Easier said than done...
