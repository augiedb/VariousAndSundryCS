We take a brief break from higher matters of computer science now to bring to you the app of the year for the Commodore 64: [Flappy Bird!](http://sos.gd/flappy64/)

This is beyond awesome for a generation of us...

Bonus Double Extra Points for the Hacker News thread linking to the page, which contains [this conversation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7292409) about the difference between loading a program with ",8,1" and just plain ",8".  These are all the details I didn't understand as a kid using a C=64, but which fascinate me today.
