Just up on ElixirDose.com now is [my introduction to the Map module and maps](http://elixirdose.com/the-new-maps-module/), in general. Not exhaustive, but a good intro to most of what you need to get started.

This is projected to be the first of three parts in the series. For part two, I'll be rewriting some previous Elixir code to move from records to maps. And in the third part, I should be talking about more Map functionality.
