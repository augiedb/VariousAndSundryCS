Book learning is easy. Book learning is great.

*It's also useless on its own.*

You don't know the questions you need answered until you sit in front of an open editor with a blinking cursor and attempt to get something done.  That's when the book learning guides you to go to the right places, ask the right questions, and discover new things.

The book is there to get you excited to sit down and start hacking away at some toy code.  It's a learning process, not necessarily a production one.  Don't start by trying to produce your application.   Start by following the examples -- TYPING THEM IN, not DOWNLOADING them -- and then messing around with them.  Repeat things.  Try completely crazy new things.  Does that crazy idea work?  Give it a shot. The worst that can happen is that you'll get a syntax error.

Experiment. Play. HACK.
