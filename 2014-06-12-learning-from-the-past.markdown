Getting back into the swing of Elixir this week, I needed to update everything.  I was still stuck on Elixir v13 and Erlang 17 RC1.

Thankfully, [I wrote a blog post about how I updated to that set-up.](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/02/21/installing-elixir-v13/) I was able to use that as my template to install Elixir 14 and everything went smoothly.

Lesson learned: Blog what you learn, because you'll need it again someday.
