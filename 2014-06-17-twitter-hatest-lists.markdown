It's bad enough that apps like TweetBot don't allow you to post a new tweet while reading in List view now, but even Twitter's own web interface has minimized Lists.

Check out this bit of crazy web design:

Get a load of that -- they hide "Lists" under "More" (with a down arrow chevron thing), which saves absolutely no space on the page at all.  It just makes an extra step for the user to get to the list.  Weird.
