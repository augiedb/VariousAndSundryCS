It's a number that comes up frequently on the internet, in sample code, in slides, in life.  Sometimes I worry that people might have forgotten its origins.

From "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy":

>“The Answer to the Great Question… Of Life, the Universe and Everything… Is… Forty-two,’ said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.”

There.  Now you've read it and not just quoted it.  Mind you, the rest of ["The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345453743/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345453743&linkCode=as2&tag=augieshcom-20&linkId=IJYXJBMP74YM4AEZ) is well worth reading, too.  

This is me killing time while I try to finish off the multiple projects I've begun in the wake of ElixirConf...  More to come!
