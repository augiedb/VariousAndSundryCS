I attended four of the five days of OSCon 2014 last week. I was mildly surprised to see all of one or two Ruby-themed panels.
 
What happened?  Has the Ruby community retreated into itself?  Are the five million Ruby-themed conferences enough?  Is OSCON considered "Not Necessary" from the Ruby community?  

I'm guessing it's just that there are so many Ruby conferences that none of those speakers bothered to submit a talk for OSCON, but maybe I'm mistaken.  Any other theories?
