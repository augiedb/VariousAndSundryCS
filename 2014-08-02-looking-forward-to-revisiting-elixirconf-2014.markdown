There are a few talks from last weekend's ElixirConf that I'm looking forward to watching again when they make their way to [ConFreaks.com](http://www.confreaks.com) in a couple of weeks.  Here's a preview:


##Dave Thomas: "Opening Keynote"

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/augiedb/14788622924" title="elixirconf-08 by Augie De Blieck, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3872/14788622924_2716510275.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="elixirconf-08"></a>

It was the first talk of the show and the one that sticks with me the most.  It's the one that made me look at programming in a different way.  "Parse and Transform" might just be the next Elixir rallying cry after this.  Thomas delivers it in an easy package.  I didn't have any problems following him as he went.  I just want to follow his logic again.




##James Smith: "Writing Command Line Applications with Elixir"

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/augiedb/14604306409" title="elixirconf-25 by Augie De Blieck, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2899/14604306409_f985e55008.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="elixirconf-25"></a>

Writing command line scripts with Elixir is something I haven't played with yet, but it's the kind of thing that might bring Elixir into my office.  For that reason, I want to watch his work again and see his code samples to get a better idea of how to do it.  Technical talks are great, but I often need to sit down with them a second time with an open vi editor and the pause button to get the most from them.



##Greg Vaughn: "Elixir Elevated"

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/augiedb/14604269340" title="elixirconf-26 by Augie De Blieck, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5595/14604269340_f53a323b38.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="elixirconf-26"></a>

Greg gave us an OTP example of an elevator in operation.  As OTP is the thing I've been working with the most lately in my own Elixir practice, this one strikes a chord with me.


##Martin Schurrer: "Otp In Production: The Nitty-Gritty Details Of Game Servers"

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/augiedb/14619632277" title="elixirconf-94 by Augie De Blieck, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3894/14619632277_209e3de623.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="elixirconf-94"></a>

Finally, Martin hit a sweet spot for me.  I've been working on a card game with Elixir since I started playing with it. I've written tutorials about shuffling a deck of cards.  I'm in the middle of one right now with OTP.   But Martin has actually done it in real life.  He talks mostly about how the OTP processes line up for the web-based card game he's a programmer on, so he's killing two birds with one stone for me here.
