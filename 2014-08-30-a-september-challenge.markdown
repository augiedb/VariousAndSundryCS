Recently, I saw someone had started a project to write 500 words a day for every day in the month of September.  I thought it was a good idea, and definitely somehting more do-able than the relatively crazy NaNoWriMo, which makes the focus of your life for a month to write every day for a month. 500 words can be done.  Heck, I write a comic review every week that comes out anywhere between 2000 and 3000 words.  Add a couple of blog posts on top of that (in theory) and I could easily hit 500 words a day for a month with very little extra effort. The idea, though, is to do it every day.  Challenging, but workable.

Would that be the best expenditure of my energy, though?  I started brainstorming other ideas for a month-long project.  Here's what I came up with:

* A Drawing a Day: I'm doing probably four or five a week right now, particularly with Sketch Dailies.  So what if I dedicated myself more to that?  What if I made it a point to draw every day, and to make it something I wasn't afraid to publich?

* A Blog Post a Day: I missed being a regular blogger, though something always seems to get in the way. I have three blogs.  Would I need to concentrate on one?  Or could I promise one post a day on any one of those sites, every day for a month?  That little bit of variety guarantees it would be easy to do.

* A comic review a day: I have a backlog of comics I want to read through.  This would force me to do that.  Problem is, reviewing individual issues of a longer storyline can sometimes be tough.  It seems like cheating to review, for example, the latest five part storyline in "Five Weapons," when I should just review the trade paperback that just came out.

* A Tech Blog Post a Day: This one is the most beneficial to my productivity, I'd have to think.  Writing technical articles would get me to learn a lot more, which is what I strive for on a daily basis already anyway.

* 30 Days of Elixir: Focusing it even more, what if I wrote something about Elixir every day for 30 days?  Small tutorials, code reviews, hints and tips, sharing code of my own, etc.?  The language is hitting 1.0 shortly, so this would be an apt celebration.

* 30 Days of Github Contributions: Forget writing about it.  What if I just coded every day?  I could light up my Github activity board a bright green with 30 straight days of "git push origin master" commands.

In the end, these are all just tricks I'd play on myself.  It's a way to force myself to focus.  Problem is, which ever one I pick will take time away from any of the others.  But is that such a bad thing?  I'm so scattered sometimes, I need some focus.

I have roughly 24 hours to figure this out. Honestly, I'm leaning towards Elixir right now.

Or not doing anything at all.  Just producing something every day for myself is more than enough.  It doesn't always have to be in public. That's just the element there to shame myself into doing the daily task.

Talking in circles. That's what I'm doing now...
