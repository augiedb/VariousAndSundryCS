* If you go to [Borders.com](http://www.borders.com) today, you get redirected to [BarnesandNoble.com](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/borders/379003142). I had forgotten that [B&N bought up Borders' "Intellectual Property"](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-26/borders-to-sell-intellectual-property-to-barnes-noble.html) after it went under.  That deal also included the Waldenbooks' IP. After all the competition goes under, might as well *own* them, eh?

* There have been times in my life I bought both the paper copy of a book and the digital copy.  At least twice it was because I didn't want to wait for the dead tree version to make it to my door, often because the book hadn't officially been published yet.  I did that with the [Big Nerd Ranch's Objective-C book](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/objective-c-programming.html) when it came in for an update a couple years back.

* I almost picked up [the NodeJS book from PragProg](https://pragprog.com/book/jwnode/node-js-the-right-way) this weekend.  At half off, it was less than $6.  The better side of me remembered that I had just bought two books and had no time to give it a chance.  I want to learn about NodeJS, just out of curiosity.  I don't have a project for it in mind yet.  Also, it's JavaScript, which always makes me shudder.  I think I'd rather learn some version of Assembler instead.
