* If you go to [Borders.com](http://www.borders.com) today, you get redirected to [BarnesandNoble.com](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/u/borders/379003142). I had forgotten that [B&N bought up Borders' "Intellectual Property"](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-09-26/borders-to-sell-intellectual-property-to-barnes-noble.html) after it went under.  That deal also included the Waldenbooks' IP. After all the competition goes under, might as well *own* them, eh?

* There have been times in my life I bought both the paper copy of a book and the digital copy.  At least twice it was because I didn't want to wait for the dead tree version to make it to my door, often because the book hadn't officially been published yet.  I did that with the [Big Nerd Ranch's Objective-C book](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/objective-c-programming.html) when it came in for an update a couple years back.

* I almost picked up [the NodeJS book from PragProg](https://pragprog.com/book/jwnode/node-js-the-right-way) this weekend.  At half off, it was less than $6.  The better side of me remembered that I had just bought two books and had no time to give it a chance.  I want to learn about NodeJS, just out of curiosity.  I don't have a project for it in mind yet.  Also, it's JavaScript, which always makes me shudder.  I think I'd rather learn some version of Assembler instead.

* I own far more Ruby eBooks than I do Perl.  My Perl book shopping days were in brick and mortar stores. My Ruby shopping days were eBooks.  My current Elixir book spree is all eBooks, just because nobody's printed one yet.  As a pre-1.0 language (for another week or so), the eBooks are all we have.  And it's been a lot of fun watching them develop alongside the language.
