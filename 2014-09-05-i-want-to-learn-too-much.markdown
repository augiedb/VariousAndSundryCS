How do you decide what to learn next?  

I'm too easily distracted. There are too many options out there.

Things I want to learn _tomorrow_:

* Elixir
* Erlang/OTP
* Phoenix for Elixir
* Perl Moose
* Perl Dancer
* Ruby on Rails/Sinatra
* Bootstrap
* Node.js
* D3.js

I don't know where to start.

I mean, I'm pretty good with the basic essentials of [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).  I can code up a data structure and can work some logic with it.  I still have some blind spots in there, specifically with the metaprogramming side of it and constructing OTP applications.  I have an unfinished card game I should get back to.  And I should probably learn [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) because, let's face it, it's the most likely avenue towards finding real world work in the language right now.  Or maybe I should learn [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com)?  Crap, let me add that to the list, too.

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) I'm learning as I go.  I'm using it at work as I update some websites, and that's just a matter of picking and choosing elements off the menu as I need them. I'm not too worried about that.  Bootstrap is super easy to use and learn.

Two different JavaScript frameworks? Yeah, that's just nutty, but I need to force myself to learn more JavaScript somehow.  It's useful for the career, you know?  I think [D3](http://d3js.org) looks more up my alley, combining some technical skills with some creative ones. Plus, there are immediate ways I can put it to work, which always makes learning something attractive, not to mention easier. ([This tutorial looks helpful.](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/about))

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) just seems so popular that I'm curious about it.  Of course, every time I start looking at a tutorial on it, my eyes rolls back into my head as they describe how the system works and what goes into it all.  And, still, JavaScript.

I have two Perl things up there because, well, I'm still a Perl programmer.  Need to learn new things there, too, since nobody else would take me as anything more than a junior developer. I'm overdue to learn [Moose](http://moose.iinteractive.com/en/).  I learned a lot of OO stuff from studying Ruby and Objective-C in recent years.  Now I want to apply that to Perl.  As a bonus, I might be able to get that working at the day job.

Then I need to learn a web framework.  I've spent too much time over the years hand-coding cgi scripts to make web pages.  Using the Perl equivalent of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) is attractive. I've done some initial tests with [Dancer](http://www.perldancer.org) and stood up a couple of working prototypes for things, so I feel good about it. It's just a matter now of getting more serious with it.

And [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) or Sinatra?  I've been wanting to buckle down and learn those for seven or eight years now.  But Rails has gotten ridiculously complicated in that time.  Maybe I should start with Sinatra and work my way into Rails?  (And, it goes without saying, brush up on Ruby, itself, along the way.)

That's my scorecard.  I believe the phrase 'running on ice' was coined for this particular reason. I feel like I'm running very fast and getting nowhere quickly.  If I could just commit to something, it might help.

Having written that all out, I can shrink the list down a bit:

* Sinatra
* Perl Dancer
* Perl Moose
* D3.js
* Elixir/Phoenix

I dropped Bootstrap off the list because it's not a concern. I can become more familiar with it as I go and as I need it.  No need to waste time making projects up for myself to learn it.  Node.js is just too much at once.  Ditto for Rails.

I still don't know where to begin.

This blog is either (a) good therapy or (b) not helping me very much with the whole "thinking things through on-line" thing.

Yup, [running on ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVihX4jjLDI).
