I've spent a lot of time in the last month working with Git. (Please note: Not [Github](http://github.com), but Git.) While I've used it in passing here and there, I've never committed myself to it.  I've been working on that.  I've set up a Git server, worked out a couple different workflows where multiple people could contribute to the source code, and just learned the ins and outs by hard experience. 

I didn't realize how little I knew until I was knee deep in doing it.

That's all a preface for three links today that I want to put a bookmark on for my own future reference:

* ["Git Pretty"](http://justinhileman.info/article/git-pretty/) is a handy flowchart that shows you which command you need to use to fix something or make something prettier in Git.

* [The chapter of the Git Book that deals with commit messages](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#Commit-Guidelines) has some wise things to say about how to format your messages, what to include in them, etc.  There are many variations available depending on what kind of workflow you're using Git with.  Obviously, [the whole Git Book](http://git-scm.com/book) is a must read, but this is a particular thing I'm working on at the moment, so I'm marking it here.

* And, of course, there's [the classic Git Flow blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  It looks wild and overwhelming at first, but once you start using it, it all makes sense.  I've just incorporated the `devel` branch idea so far, but I'm somewhat confident I could branch out into a bug fix or a hot fix if the need be.

* Bonus Bullet Point: [Here's a great chart](http://www.geekgumbo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/nvie-git-workflow-commands.png) that shows you the Git commands you'll need for the Git Flow approach.

There are still parts that feel mysterious or that I'm not completely sure I'm doing "right," but I'm starting to get the hang of it.  It beats the heck out of saving .bkp files in subdirectories...
