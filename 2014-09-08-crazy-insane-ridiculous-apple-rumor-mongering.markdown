Tomorrow is [the annual iPhone announcement](http://www.apple.com/live/), and it is not without its fair share of rumors surrounding it.  Looks like we'll get two new iPhone screen sizes, a wearable device, NFC chips, a mobile payment system, HomeKit, HealthKit, and who knows what else.

So let's take wild guesses at what can't possibly happen tomorrow:

* A video of Steve Jobs opens the presentation, with his explanation of how an iWatch would work.  The video was made weeks before his death, and Apple wants the cache of this device being his last legacy to the company.
* Ah, screw it, they're only going to announce the new large iPad.  That new white building they built out back?  That's there to hold the 65 inch iPad.
* It's not an iWatch.  It's an iBelt.
* John Mayer shows up to sing two songs at the end.
* The Apple TV steals the show, with its own App Store. It's a $20 device with your $5/month subscription to the new iTunes TV Series App that replaces network television for you.
* Yellow Submarine iPod
* Apple enters a new market: The iRiceCooker.

We'll find out tomorrow.
