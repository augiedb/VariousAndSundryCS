My new iPhone came today!  Let's check off the features:

* New, larger screen!
* Multiple apps!
* Plenty of productivity!
* A power button!  
* Super lightweight!
* Replaceable batteries!  (2 AAAs, and they last all day!)
* Add on port for new devices! (Already have the fold-out keyboard!)
* A stylus! (Steve Jobs feinted us again!)
* Handwriting recognition!
* Padded carrying case!
