*Major Update ( September 12, 2014 )* So major, I'm putting it up front.  Mark Jason Dominus, the author of "Higher Order Perl" tweeted at me with a couple of corrections.  I'll just reprint them here:


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/augiedb">@augiedb</a> Higher-Order Perl isn&#39;t out of print, and it wasn&#39;t published by O&#39;Reilly; I don&#39;t know why they are selling it for $81.</p>&mdash; Mark Jason Dominus (@mjdominus) <a href="https://twitter.com/mjdominus/status/510526501436293120">September 12, 2014</a></blockquote>

So the story is even weirder than previously thought. I apologize for the misrepresentations.

Now you know the rest of the story...

Here's what I wrote originally:

 
Continuing our look into the world of eBooks and computer learning...

"Higher Order Perl" is a book from Mark Jason Dominus.  You can buy it today from O'Reilly as an eBook only.  The paper edition is out of print, so eBook is your only choice.  [That honor will run you a whopping $81.95.](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781558607019.do)

But, hey, it's out of print.  It's very highly technical.  It treats Perl as a functional language at a time today when functional is the new hotness.  It's worth it, right?

There is one issue here. Dominus made his book [a free download](http://hop.perl.plover.com/book/) a while back.  He retains the copyright on the material and accepts donations, but the ebook is basically free now.  In fact, it _is_ the eBook:

> This is the publisher's own PDF proof of the second version, which was sent to the printers in August 2005.

O'Reilly has its issues with pricing eBooks, but this one takes the cake.
