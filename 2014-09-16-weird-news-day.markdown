In the news today:

In the worst possible news: [Patent Trolls have won million dollar podcasting judgment against CBS.](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/jury-finds-cbs-infringes-podcasting-patent-awards-1-3-million/) I'm so mad I could spit. This one patent is enough to radicalize me against the entire patent system. Abolish the whole thing now.

[Microsoft is making a physical keyboard for iPads.](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6189075/microsoft-universal-mobile-keyboard-features-pricing)  They don't have a Windows key.  In so many ways, Microsoft is a confusing company.  This would have been more confusing, I grant you, if it was a virtual keyboard for iOS. I wouldn't rule that out at this point.  It's like there's two Microsofts -- the one that's focused on Windows and Office over everything, and everyone else who wants to make cross-platform hardware and software products.  Microsoft needs to either pick a side or, yes, split itself up. It's working against itself in so many ways.

Yes, I know they've made keyboards for all computers for a long time. Lots of people love their mice. But going after the tablet market now is another example of how Microsoft had divisions who are interested in things that the other divisions would find heart-stoppingly awful.  I don't know how anything gets done over there.

Microsoft also announced a date to announce Windows 9.  [The invitation for that event](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6189075/microsoft-universal-mobile-keyboard-features-pricing) looks like a Blue Screen of Death. Whoops.

[Clear Channel is now iHeartMedia.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/business/media/embracing-digital-brand-clear-channel-renames-itself-iheartmedia.html?_r=0)  I can't help but feel that's a name that'll feel very old very soon.  It's just a little too cutesy, you know? 

The awesome Paper app by FiftyThree is [now offering what amount to templates for the app.](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6154513/fiftythree-mix-paper-for-ipad)  OK, that's not weird. It's kind of cool.
