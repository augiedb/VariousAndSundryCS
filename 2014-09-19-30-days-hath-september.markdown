I don't know that I ever mentioned it on the blog before now, but [my goal in September](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/08/30/a-september-challenge/) was to post to this blog every single day.  It started when I noticed someone else doing some kind of 30 days challenge for September.  I think the goal was to write 500 words every day, which for many people is roughly a blog post.  For me, that 500 number showed up a lot, but it wasn't the goal. 

The goal was to build momentum in blogging again. I wanted to see if blogging would beget blogging. I wanted to see if I had anything to say, or could find new things to say every day.

That all seemed to work out, though it didn't go quite as expected.

I didn't expect this to turn into a Perl blog.  I write Perl for my day job, but usually spend my hobby time at night doing something else. Lately, it's been Elixir, which I still love. But work got busy and some of that bled into my hobby time in the best possible way. I've been learning lots of new things to help modernize what we have at work. I'm enjoy that tremendously and spending lots of time at nights working on new Perl things that I can bring back to work.

(The cynical out there would call this **Resume Driven Development**.  Honestly, I just enjoy it.)

But spending time with Perl kept bringing up interesting topics, mostly about how far the Perl world has fallen, but still...

I had hoped to write more substantial posts.  More tutorials.  More code samples.  I just didn't generate that kind of material this month for various reasons.

I have a few posts I'm very proud of, though:

* ["Learning What I'm Learning"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/27/learning-what-im-learning/) was something of a personal revelation.

* ["Apple Watch Price Watch: Just Like Comics"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/22/apple-watch-price-watch-just-like-comics/) let me bring an outside perspective into the tech industry, from my other major writing gig.

* ["RubyConf 2014 Speaker Lineup"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/22/apple-watch-price-watch-just-like-comics/) did much the same, this time with the realization that the conference is being held at the same site as the San Diego Comic-Con.

* ["The Sad State of Too Many Perl Videos"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/17/technical-exercise/) likely applies outside of Perl, too.  It let me vent my general frustrations in using one of the key tools I've learned lots of Ruby/OO progrmaming from, and how it fails miserably with Perl.  As Perl begins [to attempt to re-market itself](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/30/how-to-save-perl/), perhaps an investment in high quality speaker videos would be a worthy idea.  Right now, the best of them are behind a paywall via OS Con.

* ["Diabetes Comes to HealthKit"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/15/diabetes-comes-to-healthkit/) let me share a big chunk of my life from a different angle, partially to refute all the uninformed stories about blood glucose monitoring being an Apple Watch possbility.

* ["Perl Did That First"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/page/3/) could almost be a regular series showing off all the ways other languages are doing what Perl did a long time ago without getting credit for it.  The same is true on the flip side, which ["Watching a Language Lose Momentum"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/03/watching-a-language-lose-momentum/) exemplified.

* ["The Perl Roadmap"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/11/the-perl-roadmap/) explores what Perl's future might and should be.

* ["Elixir Hits 1.0"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/10/elixir-hits-1-dot-0/) let me finally use a drawing I did on flight to either OSCon or ElixirConf over the summer.

* ["I Want to Learn Too Much"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/05/i-want-to-learn-too-much/) is still a problem. This is a post I should likely follow up on.  There's been some movement on those items.

* ["TDD Rewires Your Brain"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/02/tdd-rewires-your-brain/) explored what I learned from my first major test of TDD at the day job.

* ["Book Stores Are No Good for Programming Books"](http://variousandsundry.com/cs/blog/2014/09/01/book-stores-are-no-good-for-programming-books/) let me vent more frustrations over a trip to Barnes and Noble, and just how much things have changed since I onece attempted to learn Rails 7 years ago.

So, yeah, good month.  Wish it was **more** technical. Wish there was more code examples.  But I accomplished what I set out to do in broad strokes.

Now I'm having trouble deciding what to do with October.  Better think fast...  There's always [Inktober](http://mrjakeparker.com/inktober), but I don't think I could manage the time on that one... I did one today (the [Venom Pez Dispenser](http://instagram.com/p/tnJwl_mi1r/), but that was just dumb luck.  (Also, I'm not very good at inking. Not good at all.)

Stay tuned...
