David Cross’ book “Data Munging With Perl” came out in 2001.  It’s out of print now, and [available in its original PDF form free from its author.]( http://perlhacks.com/2014/04/data-munging-perl/)
 
Check out this excerpt from the book’s preface:
 
> Over the last five years there has been an explosion of interest in Perl.  This is largely because of the huge boost that Perl received when it was adopted as the de facto language for creating content on the World Wide Web.  Perl's powerful text manipulation facilities made it an obvious choice for writing Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.  In the wake of the web's popularity, Perl has become one of the hottest programming languages current in use.

> Unfortunately, a side effect of this association with CGI programming has been the popular misconception that this is Perl's sole function. Some people even believe that Perl was designed for use in CGI programming.  This is clearly wrong as Perl was, in fact, written long before the design of the CGI protocol.

And then today, Justin Weiss posts the answer to the eternal question, ["Can you learn Rails before learning Ruby?"](http://www.justinweiss.com/blog/2014/09/22/can-you-learn-rails-before-learning-ruby/)

Or how about a more classic variation: [Do I need to know Ruby in order to learn Ruby on Rails?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2514345/do-i-need-to-know-ruby-in-order-to-learn-ruby-on-rails)
 
I fear Ruby is going down the Perl path already...
