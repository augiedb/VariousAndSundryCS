As a guy who's been known [to wield a DSLR in Manual mode only](http://augieshoots.com), one of the most anticipated additions to iOS 8 for me has been full manual control of the camera inside apps.

The [Manual app](http://shootmanual.co) looks to be the first one:

It won't be handy for all occasions, but it should give me enough flexibility to nail shots when I have the time to set them up properly...
