[This is a 2004 email from the Linux Kernel mailing list from Linus Torvalds.](https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/20/255)  It's been floating across Twitter today and deserves a read.  It's all about the necessity of dealing with small contributions to open source projects. Speaking as someone whose main contributions to Open Source have been documentation corrections to Elixir, I appreciate his thoughts here:

> To me, the biggest thing with small patches is not necessarily the patch itself. I think that much more important than the patch is the fact that people get used to the notion that they can change the kernel - not just on an intellectual level ("I understand that the GPL means that I have the right to change my kernel"), but on a more practical level ("Hey, I did that small change").

OK, so my "patches" didn't even go that far, but it's good exercise. Practice is a good thing.
