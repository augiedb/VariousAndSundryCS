Some weekend video watching:

* O'Reilly is selling [a new video training series by Damian Conway](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/110000790.do?code=WKOPNS) on writing Modern Perl.  That should be useful for Perl programmers.  It is a for-pay series of videos, but the link includes a code to get you
half off for a limited time.

The rest of the videos are free, though:

* [Garrett Smith's Erlang Factory talk on "Writing Quality Code in Erlang"](http://youtu.be/CQyt9Vlkbis) is up on YouTube already.

* [Katrina Owens' "Overkill" talk from E4E](http://confreaks.com/videos/4613-e4e2014-overkill) is now up on Confreaks.

* Also from E4E comes [Merlin Mann's "Advanced Tricycling."](http://confreaks.com/videos/4617-e4e2014-advanced-tricycling) I have no idea what that's about, but I'm sure it'll be worth watching.  It's also his first talk up on ConFreaks.
