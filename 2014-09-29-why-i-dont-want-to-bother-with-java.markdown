I know, I know.  Some people can't pick their language.  They're stuck with what they're stuck with.  For those people, Java rules.  It's been a major language for a long time now.  Can't deny its "popularity."

I tried to get into it once, but it's a miserable language to work with. The JVM is impressive, but the syntax drives me mad.  It's a cosmetic thing, I know, bet even [the "Hello World" example] turns me off:

    class HelloWorldApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Display the string.
        }
    }

    10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD!"

I'd sooner give up lower case letters than deal with Java, thanks...
