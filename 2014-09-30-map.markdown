I loaded up [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) to find directions to a birthday party in the area this weekend.  The name of the place started "Be".  At that point, Google stepped in to offer suggestions of where I might like to go.

Their first option was Belgium.

OK, not exactly the place in Northern New Jersey that I was looking for, but what the heck?  I clicked on it:

That's pretty fancy, right there.  It offers directions to the airport and a schedule of flights, along with their approximate prices.

I'm still not going to Belgium, but that's pretty cool.
