If you've seen Dave Thomas' "Elixir: The Power of Erlang, the Joy of Ruby" talk in the past, you know the script.

But now it's changed.  If you've seen Dave Thomas' ElixirConf presentation, ["Think Different"](http://confreaks.com/videos/4119-elixirconf2014-opening-keynote-think-different), then you know about his "Parse and Transform" revelation.

Now he's combined the two talks to update the "Power" talk.  There's video from the Goto; Conference available now to see the update:

He live codes for close to 40 minutes to show about transformation and -- the camera is zoomed in and doesn't show the screen until about 27 minutes in.  UGH UGH UGH.  Can't wait for the next time Dave gives this talk and ConFreaks records it. They've spoiled us into expecting more from these con videos...
