HBO announced today it'll begin [selling its services outside of the cable company lockup](http://recode.net/2014/10/15/hbo-says-its-going-to-start-selling-on-the-web-next-year/) next year.

Could HBO be signaling the beginning of the end for the current horrible cable system?  I hope so, but I'm also pessimistic enough to know there are a dozen ways this could go horribly wrong and for HBO to create a product everyone wants in a way that nobody will buy it.

Then there's this:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Day before Apple event HBO announces complete independence from subscription cable model.</p>&mdash; Collin Ruffenach (@cruffenach) <a href="https://twitter.com/cruffenach/status/522415332955148288">October 15, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The iPad is the big focus of the event, of course.  But maybe there's a new software offering for Apple TV, too?  Or maybe HBO's "next year" time frame aligns it with a new Apple TV in 2015Q1?

We live in exciting times...
