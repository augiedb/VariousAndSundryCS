I don't do any object oriented programming.  Crazy, right?  But I really don't at this time.

Sure, there are some Perl modules I use that are OO, and I've created one or two that are OO, also, but I can't claim that my daily duties at work consist of me figuring out whether to inject some dependency or compose some new objects.

Yet I'm fascinated by that stuff, probably because I don't have to actually deal with it on a daily basis.  Theory is easy; practice is _hard_.

Sandi Metz's latest talk is awesome.  If you've read POODR (and you should), you'll love this.  If you haven't read POODR, you should like this, too.

__Fair Warning:__ Pay close attention. Block off some time to _pay attention_ to this.  It's worth it.
