O'Reilly doesn't give away the videos of the presentations at OSCon, ironically enough.  You have to buy them as a package.

They do, however, live cast the keynotes on a daily basis to the internet and post those videos on-line immediately.

Here are my favorites:

"Situation Normal, Everything Must Change" by Simon Wardley
{% youtube Ty6pOVEc3bA %}

"The Future is Awesome" by Paul Fenwick
{% youtube c7TwbTt%ofLo %}

"Making Architecture Matter" by Martin Fowler
{% youtube nbgAZyWMGR0 %}

"Change-Making at the Largest Public Interest Startup" by Mikey Dickerson
{% youtube y6nMQg9qs7k %}

If you can only watch one, I'd go with Simon Wardley's...
