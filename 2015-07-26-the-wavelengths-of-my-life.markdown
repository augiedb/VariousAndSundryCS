_I wrote this last week while attending OSCon 2015 in Portland, OR._

This week, I have the following items on my person at nearly all times:

* A lanyard that includes an RFID chip that gets scanned when I walk into conference rooms.

* A keyfob for my car rental. It's one of those keyless cars, so I keep it in my pocket and can un-lock the door just by pulling on the handle, and start it by pushing a button.

* My hotel keycard, which I tap on the door to unlock.

* My Continuous Glucose Monitor, which sends a low-power radio signal every five minutes to --

* My insulin pump, which receives the CGM signals and also occasional signals from --

* My blood glucose monitor, which is in my backpack.

* My cell phone, with Blu Tooth turned on for proper podcast listening in the car and calls home. Plus, a cellular radio in constant contact with a series of towers across the area.

If I turn green when I get home, this is why.
