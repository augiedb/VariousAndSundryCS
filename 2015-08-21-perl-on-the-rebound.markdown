Is this the beginning of a trend -- people from other languages recognizing Perl's accomplishments?  Or just a coincidence?

 * ["From the languages which Iâ€™ve used, only Perl has tried to
address the problem."](http://www.koszek.com/blog/2015/08/17/i-wish-ruby-and-python-stopped-changing-so-much/)
 * ["We're Still Catching Up to
Perl"](http://devblog.avdi.org/2015/08/07/were-still-catching-up-to-perl/)

And, finally, just because I thought it was cool, here's a Perl/Ruby Quote of the Year:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Larry Wall and Matz keynoted at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/yapcasia?src=hash">#yapcasia</a>.
