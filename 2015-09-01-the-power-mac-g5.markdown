Boy, [this article](http://www.macworld.com/article/2975281/macs/the-power-mac-g5-is-one-of-apples-best-designs.html) couldn't have been much better timed.  It's a look back at the Power Mac G5 desktop computer, which was my first Apple computer. I wish they still made it, because I'd buy another today.  The fans were incredibly loud, and I had to upgrade from mine when one of them basically died, but I liked how easy it was to add or remove things on the inside. Alas, the Pentium PC chip proved to be the ultimate limiting factor...
