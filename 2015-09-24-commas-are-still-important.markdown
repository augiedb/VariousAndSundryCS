Not really a tech post, but the writer in me cringed and had to get this out of his system.

Not to be completely pedantic, but when people argue over the Oxford comma and the use of commas in general, this is the kind of sentence they like clarification on.

I had to read that sentence two or three times before I realize (I think) that a comma after "iPads" would help a lot.  Even better.  End that sentence after "iPads" and start the next sentence with "Macs are mostly..."  Even better than that, I think this is a great place for a semi-colon:

 > This younger generation does use PCs. However, they actually spend the most time on their iPhones and iPads; Macs are mostly relegated to serious productivity projects. 

It's such a crucial sentence in the paragraph and in the piece, over all, that I'm surprised it made it through.

You may now all do the proper internet thing and pick apart this post for all my grammatical errors.
