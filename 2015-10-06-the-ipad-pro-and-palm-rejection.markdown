At the iPad Pro unveiling last month, the folks doing demos on stage had one noticeable tic: None of them wanted to use the pencil while placing their hand on the screen.  

And in the videos introducing the iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil, many of the people drawing did so with a conspicuously raised hand.

I admit it; I was one of those who was worried that the palm rejection wasn't good on the device.

Recently, [Apple sent some iPad Pros over to PIXAR to try out](https://twitter.com/drwave/status/648592633615421441), and the response was positive, along with word that palm rejection was "perfect."

So I went back to the videos from the original introduction and watched them with fresh eyes.  Guess what?

There are plenty of examples in the two videos of people drawing with their fleshy palms on the screen at the same time.

From the [iPad Pro introduction video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlYC8gDvutc) and the  [Apple Pencil introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iicnVez5U7M):

Even the  pinky can't distract the iPad Pro

Lesson learned? We often find proof to fit our own narratives, when the truth is staring us right in the face.

I think Confucius taught me that.
