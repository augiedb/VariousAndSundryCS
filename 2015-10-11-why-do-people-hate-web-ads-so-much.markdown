Click on link to see video.

Scroll down the page to get to video.  

Scroll down again because a video ad just popped up above it and started autoplaying because I scrolled past it.

Play video.

Click the "X" button to close the ad that's in the middle of the video.

Scroll up now because the pop up ad video just finished and closed and the whole page just auto scrolled back up.

Watch video.  10 seconds before the end, close the next ad that pops up to block my view of the video.

The web is an annoying place to go these days...
