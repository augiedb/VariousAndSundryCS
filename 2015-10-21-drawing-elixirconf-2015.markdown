Things can start so innocently before they snowball.

I'm growing increasingly antsy in my old age.  I can't sit still and watch a video anymore to the exclusion of anything else.  So when I sat down to watch some ElixirConf 2015 talks, I started doodling.

The first couple came out OK, so I soon started skipping to other videos just to doodle some more.  

I don't do caricatures, but I did do this tonight:

This is the first one I drew, super fast and super small and loose.  In my mind, there's more detail to be had, but I am proud of getting most of the pattern of her top correct. ;-)

Remember Jessica's message: Write Elixir blog posts!  This counts.  Right, <A HREF="https://twitter.com/jessitron">Jessitron</A>?  Maybe?

I watched the first half of this talk. I'm not sure if my mind is blown or just terribly confused.

I just wanted to draw the hair, in all honesty...

This counts. Right, Wendy?  Maybe?

Hey, he used my art in his slideshow.  I __had__ to look at this one!

I'm looking forward to watching this, just because Stephen was the first person I ever met (at ElixirConf 2014) with an Elixir app in production.  I'm interested in seeing how much further he's gone in the last year.

I briefly considered attempting to draw this whole panel, but then sanity set in.

OK, that's it for tonight's drawing exercises.  I should go watch one of these talks now.  

Will there ever be a part two of this?  You never know...
